# Analogue_Test_Board

Designed to Run on the PIC16F676 microprocessor, but can also run on any 8 pin PIC chip as they share the exact same pin numbering on 
the top 8 pins. Running the code on the processor causes each of the colours on the RGB LED to vary in brightness based on the position
of potentiometers on the board.  More information for this one can be found on my website :)
